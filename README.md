This project is a fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The user interface is styled for a modern look, and the calculator dynamically updates the display as users interact with it.
